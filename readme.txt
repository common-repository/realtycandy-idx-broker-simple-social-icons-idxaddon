This allows you to insert social icons in any widget area. These icons will display correctly on IDX Broker pages like search, results and details. 


== Description ==

IDX Broker Simple Social Icons is an easy to use, customizable way to display icons that link visitors to your various social profiles. With it, you can easily choose which profiles to link to, customize the color and size of your icons, as well as align them to the left, center, or right, all from the widget form (no settings page necessary!).

This is a fork of Nathan Riceâ€™s plugin.  There were some issues with the icons not displaying correctly on IDX Broker pages.  These issues were addressed with this plugin.
